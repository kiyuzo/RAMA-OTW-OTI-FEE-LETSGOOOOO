## 1. **Project Description** ðŸ“Ž
  This is a project that i submitted for OmahTI's Open Recruitment 2024 Front End division.

## 2. **Features and Explanation** ðŸ“²
   ### a. Dark Mode
       - Dark mode can be enabled by clicking the moon button.
       - You can toggle back to light mode by clicking the sun button during dark mode.
       - While in dark mode, almost everything is inverted, including the toggle icon, the menu icon while you're device's width is under 900px, and the icon (favicon) on your tab right beside the OmahTi Press title.
       - EXTRA NOTE! i made a little notification for the dark mode when the website is loaded. I did this because a few days ago, i showed my work to one of my friend and he asked me about the moon icon if it's just a decoration or actually a button that you can click on. His question made me thought that maybe i should make the button more obvious so that people would actually notice that it is actually a real button and not just some kind of decoration. One way is to notify the user as soon as they enter the web so that it would convince the user to click on the button and guarantees that every user will click the button atleast once in their first time loading up the website.
  
  ### b. See More
       - When you scroll down to the "What's New" page, there is a see more button on the "Discover Topics" and "Writer of The Month"
       - When you click on it, it will show more Discoverable Topics or Writers of The Month.
       - To close it, simply clicked the collapse button and it will go back to normal.

  ### c. Max Character
       - This feature is kinda hard to notice because it will only activates if your device's width is under 900px.
       - When you open this web in a device with it's width larger than 900px, if you look at the "What's New" description, it'll look completely normal.
       - But, as soon as you minimize it to under 900px, the description will be shortened to at max 100 characters with "..." (three dots) at the end, showing that this content has too many characters on it's description and it needs to be reduced somehow so that it won't ruin the font-size.
       - When you want to go back to width larger than 900px, the description will go back to normal since i stored the old description on a variable called text on my javascript file.
       - In my most updated commit, you can spam this by going back and forth in 900px and it would not ruin the description. (before i updated it, you had to refresh it to make it change, now that i have used resize as the addEventListener's type, we don't have to wait until the user refreshes the web instead we wait until the page or window is resized then change the max character :D)
       
  ### d. Load Notification for Dark Mode
       - As i was saying earlier in the Dark Mode section, i made this because most people would overlook this feature so i added a notification when the web is loaded so that user would actually clicked on it everytime they opened up the website for the first time.

  ### e. Tons of CSS hover animation
       - I made a lot of CSS hover animation, including the navigation list, the sign up/in button, the lists in the dropdown menu, the discover topics' topic, the see more button, the information and follow us lists, and the subcribe button (i hope i didn't miss any).
       - In my perspective, this is a actually a must in almost every front end project because with a simple addition you can make your web much more delicant even with the most basic animation, the background change animation for instance.

  ### f. Web Responsivity
       - When you minimize the web to under 900px, the layout will change, the trending page will be stacked instead of side by side, the navigation list will form into a menu icon that you can click on to access the navigation list and the sign in/up button.
       - You can access this web using a phone with a width over 390px and it will look just as great as the desktop version.
       - When you access this web using a device with a width lower than 390px, it will not look as great but you can still access all the features.

  ### g. Email link actually worked??
       - YESS if you click on the email on the footer, it'll open up a new tab and automatically fill the targeted email so you don't have to worry about how to send your critics and suggestions to me, just click on the email and go on.

  ### h. What's with these images? why is there so many cats?
       - For the images, i made the alts the same as the original name of the picture to not make any confusion for the user when the image is not loaded properly.
       - For the assets name, i used the name shown in the figma and not the real name of the original image to make it easier for me to manage the images for each elements.
       - Who are these peoples in the profile pictures? for the profile pictures on the "What's New" Section they are actually the original image of what i searched, so when i put up Rob Maine on google images for example, i downloaded the first picture that comes up and make it as the profile pict. For the "Writer's of the Month" section, the pictures that i used are either billionaires or millionaires, singer or musician, or the biggest tech people.
       - WHY ARE THEY SO MANY CATS MEME? well the thing is that the person who gave the assignment told us to put anything on the selected slot, and the first thing that came up to my mind was cats so i just put up a bunch of cats meme because who doesn't like cats? I do. You don't? i guess we can't be friends then (JK, fun fact the one at the very bottom is my cat).
